# dpimgmt
A set of scripts to manage X11 font dpi with keyboard shortcuts.

These scripts can help with the annoyance that comes with switching monitors, connecting to docks, etc. that can come with mobility on a Linux desktop (ymmv... this is a problem for me with xfce).

Because your Linux desktop might not know the difference between your 14" laptop screen at 1920x180 vs a 32" monitor at 1920x1080, you can get some pretty unusable DPIs by default. Bind these scripts to hotkeys and make that problem go away.

Modify the target DPI in `dpitoggle.sh` to suit your preference - I have mine at 106, and the default at 95. Tune to suit as needed.

Put the scripts on your path (or wherever) and bind your hotkeys to useful key combos and you're good to go.
